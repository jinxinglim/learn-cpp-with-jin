#### Key takeaways

1. C++ is a native language as such that it directly compiles source code into machine code, i.e., C++ source code (written) -> Compiler (compilation) -> Machine code (instructions for machine to run).
2. As different machines (e.g., Windows, Macs, Linux, etc) use different machine code, it is important to choose the right compiler to compile your C++ source code to the appropriate machine code.
3. Other languages such as C#, Java, etc works differenly as they run on virtual machines (VMs) that compile the source code to an intermediate language first. When the application runs the program in the VM, it will then get compiled into apprpriate machine code.
