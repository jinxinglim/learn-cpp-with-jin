# Learn C++ with Jin

This repository will document and contain all the key takeaways and codes throughout my process of learning C++.
I will be learning it through following the [Youtube playlist, C++](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&si=eAUec1IBcU8OovFy), by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw).

For each Youtube video that I learn from, I will include the following contents:
- Link to the Youtube video
- Link to the code used in the lesson
- Key takeaways

Note that all learning materials originated from [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw) and I do not own any of them.
This repository is only meant for keeping track of my progress while learning C++.
I am making this repository public in case the key takeaways would be useful for anyone.
