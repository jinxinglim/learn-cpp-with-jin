# Learn C++ with Jin

This repository will document and contain all the key takeaways and codes throughout my process of learning C++.
I will be learning it through following the [Youtube playlist, C++](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&si=eAUec1IBcU8OovFy), by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw).

For each Youtube video that I learn from, I will include the following contents:
- Link to the Youtube video
- Link to the code used in the lesson
- Key takeaways

Note that all learning materials originated from [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw) and I do not own any of them.
This repository is only meant for keeping track of my progress while learning C++.
I will only include lessons that I have gone through, and thus, it will not contain all the videos 
from the playlist.
I am making this repository public in case the key takeaways would be useful for anyone.
To fully utilize this repository, I would suggest the following:
1. Follow the respective Youtube video that the key takeaways are based on.
2. Write the code that is used in the video.
3. After the video is over, read the key takeaways and compare them with your understanding.
